ADPET: An Attributed and Diverse Encoder-Decoder Processing Technique for Anomaly Detection

ADEPT
This research focuses on the encoder-decoder methodology to improve and gain insights into the existing studies. This architecture compresses the graph into a latent space and then reconstructs them, to identify or rank anomalies based on the reconstruction errors.

ADEPT uses datasets commonly used in other anomaly detection research like BlogCatalog, Flickr, and ACM along with a recently published real-world dataset DGraph-Fin.
